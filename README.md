# Github-Scrapper
This code is a web scrapper that scrapes the topic part of Github and the first 8 repos of each topic. It then prints all the issues of these repos in a PDF file. The code is written in Node.js and uses the cheerio library for web scraping. The PDF files are generated using the pdfkit library. The code exports a function named "getIssues" that takes a URL of the issues page and the path to the PDF file. The main code uses this function to scrape the topics page, access each topic page, scrape the first 8 repos, and generate PDFs for each repo's issues. The code also uses the request library to send HTTP requests and the fs library to handle file system operations. The final PDF files are organized into directories based on the topics and the repos.
